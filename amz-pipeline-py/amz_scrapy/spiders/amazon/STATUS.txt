PRODUCT DETAILS PAGES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Scraper for product details web pages hits 503 every N requests. This seems to
get worsen as we continue sending requests from concurrent workers. Amazon seems
to link our requests together and start banning proxies. The ban seems to be get
lifted at least the next day.

It looks like scraping methods using JSON APIs (internal) are more permissive, as
well as access to the web pages for bestsellers.
